Instrustions:
We used 127.0.0.1 to test, but we would like to use a real IP to test.
Run ifconfig to see the IP's for the server side. Look for the Inet IP
	Within client.cpp, in string ipAddress = "" but in your IP

Run ./driver.sh to make sure the executable files are up to date with the new IP.
(Must run every time to clear ports/IP)

Since this is being ran on one VM,
open two terminals, one will be your server, and one will be your client.

Run ./passwordCrack to start the server side
Run ./client to start the client side

Once they connect, you will be prompted to enter a password on the client side.

From there enter the password and hit enter and it will run the test
